        <TextOnlySection>
          <p>I am a final-year Computer Engineering student at Sharif University of Technology, with a strong focus on adversarial attacks in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). My research interests lie at the intersection of bias, fairness, and the vulnerabilities of LLMs to adversarial manipulation in natural language processing. Through both my academic studies and industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at Yektanet and System Group, I have developed a deep understanding of the challenges posed by these models. My recent publication addresses the bias inherent in LLMs and explores methods to enhance their fairness and explore their biases. I am eager to bring my expertise to a research team committed to advancing AI in a way that is both ethical and robust against adversarial threats.</p>
