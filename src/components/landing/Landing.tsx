        <TextOnlySection>
          <p>I am a final-year Computer Engineering student at Sharif University of Technology, with a strong focus on adversarial attacks in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). My research interests lie at the intersection of bias, fairness, and the vulnerabilities of LLMs to adversarial manipulation in natural language processing. Through both my academic studies and industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at Yektanet and System Group, I have developed a deep understanding of the challenges posed by these models. My recent publication addresses the bias inherent in LLMs and explores methods to enhance their fairness and explore their biases. I am eager to bring my expertise to a research team committed to advancing AI in a way that is both ethical and robust against adversarial threats.</p>

        <Typography variant="h6" color="white" className="text-left">Conducted research to develop metrics for assessing alignment, diversity, and quality in diffusion-based image
          generators across various prompts.
          Developed a comprehensive pipeline for image generation, incorporating prompt rewriting to enhance diversity and
          quality, followed by image generation and rigorous testing for quality, diversity, and alignment to identify optimal
          outputs.
          Performed statistical analyses to detect gender bias in actions using verb + object combinations generated by GPT
          and crawled from the LAION dataset.
          Investigated methodologies to mitigate biases in task-specific generated images through prompt tuning and inpainting
          techniques, leading to a paper accepted at ECAI 2024.
          Collaborated on research in self-supervised representation learning, where I implemented contrastive learning
          methodologies, including the Barlow Twins method, to enhance model performance and robustness and VICReg
          (Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization) to stabilize the training process, further improving the eï¬€iciency and
          reliability of the model.</Typography>
